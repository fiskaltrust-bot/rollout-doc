### fiskaltrust.PosArchive

fiskaltrust.PosArchive is a **portal service** which provides a searchable, secure, and **audit-proof** database for your receipts, sent to the online-working fiskaltrust.Middleware. Activating it for a Queue will enable its fiskaltrust.Middleware instance to regularly push its new receipts into the archive, where they'll be securely persisted in a audit-proof receipt chain.

Stored receipt data can be accessed and exported at any time via the portal (e.g. for a fiscal audit). In accordance with Austrian regulations, data is kept for at least seven years after the end of the year of generating.
